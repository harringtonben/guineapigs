# Guinea Pig

> this app will do the following

* When a user hovers over the 'Page Title' the output area will display text letting you know you are in the header
* When you mouse away from the header, it will let you know you have left the header
* When you click on each section of the article it will tell you which section you clicked on
* If you input text in the text input, it will write in real time to the page
* If you hit the add color button, it will turn the text 'Leave me alone' blue
* If you hit the hulkify button, it will increase the size of the text 'Leave me alone'
* If you hit the capture it button, it will add a border around the text 'Leave me alone'
* If you hit the rounded button, it will add a slight border radius to the text 'Leave me alone'
